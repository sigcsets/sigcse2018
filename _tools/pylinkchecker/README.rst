pylinkchecker
=============

:Version: 0.2pre

pylinkchecker is a standalone and pure python link checker and crawler that
traverses a web site and reports errors (e.g., 500 and 404 errors) encountered.
The crawler can also download resources such as images, scripts and
stylesheets.

pylinkchecker's performance can be improved by installing additional libraries
that require a C compiler, but these libraries are optional.

We created pylinkchecker so that it could be executed in environments without
access to a compiler (e.g., Microsoft Windows, some *nix production
environments) or with an old version of python (e.g., Centos).

pylinkchecker is highly modular and has many configuration options, but the
only required parameter is the starting url: pylinkcheck.py
http://www.example.com/

pylinkchecker can also be used programmatically by calling one of the functions
in ``pylinkchecker.api``

Quick Start
-----------

Install pylinkchecker with pip or easy_install:

::

  pip install pylinkchecker


Crawl all pages from a site and show progress:

::

  pylinkcheck.py -P http://www.example.com/


Requirements
------------

pylinkchecker does not require external libraries if executed with python 2.x.
It requires beautifulsoup4 if executed with python 3.x. It has been tested on
python 2.6, python 2.7, and python 3.3.

For production use, it is strongly recommended to use lxml or html5lib because
the default HTML parser provided by python is not very lenient.


Optional Requirements
---------------------

These libraries can be installed to enable certain modes in pylinkchecker:

lxml
  beautifulsoup can use lxml to speed up the parsing of HTML pages. Because
  lxml requires C libraries, this is only an optional requirement.

html5lib
  beautifulsoup can use html5lib to process incorrect or strange markup. It is
  slower than lxml, but believed to be more lenient.

gevent
  this non-blocking io library enables pylinkchecker to use green threads
  instead of processes or threads. gevent could potentially speed up the
  crawling speed on web sites with many small pages.

cchardet
  this library speeds up the detection of document encoding.

Usage Example
-------------

Crawl a site and show progress
  ``pylinkcheck.py --progress http://example.com/``

Crawl a site starting from 2 URLs
  ``pylinkcheck.py http://example.com/ http://example2.com/``

Crawl a site (example.com) and all pages belonging to another host
  ``pylinkcheck.py -H additionalhost.com http://example.com/``

Report status of all links (even successful ones)
  ``pylinkcheck.py --report-type=all http://example.com/``

Report status of all links and HTML show source of these links
  ``pylinkcheck.py --report-type=all --show-source http://example.com/``

Only crawl starting URLs and access all linked resources
  ``pylinkcheck.py --run-once http://example.com/``

Only access links (a href) and ignore images, stylesheets and scripts
  ``pylinkcheck.py --types=a http://example.com/``

Crawl a site with 4 threads (default is one thread)
  ``pylinkcheck.py --workers=4 http://example.com/``

Crawl a site with 4 processes (default is one thread)
  ``pylinkcheck.py --mode=process --workers=4 http://example.com/``

Crawl a site and use LXML to parse HTML (faster, must be installed)
  ``pylinkcheck.py --parser=LXML http://example.com/``

Print debugging info
  ``pylinkcheck.py --verbose=2 http://example.com/``


API Usage
---------

To crawl a site from a single URL:

.. code-block:: python

  from pylinkchecker.api import crawl
  crawled_site = crawl("http://www.example.com/")
  number_of_crawled_pages = len(crawled_site.pages)
  number_of_errors = len(crawled_sites.error_pages)


To crawl a site and pass some configuration options (the same supported by the
command line interface):


.. code-block:: python

  from pylinkchecker.api import crawl_with_options
  crawled_site = crawl_with_options(["http://www.example.com/"], {"run-once":
      True, "workers": 10})
  number_of_crawled_pages = len(crawled_site.pages)
  number_of_errors = len(crawled_sites.error_pages)


FAQ and Troubleshooting
-----------------------

I cannot find pylinkcheck.py on Windows with virtualenv
  This is a known problem with virtualenv on windows. The interpreter is
  different than the one used by the virtualenv. Prefix pylinkcheck.py with the
  full path: ``python c:\myvirtualenv\Scripts\pylinkcheck.py``

I see Exception KeyError ... module 'threading' when using --mode=green
  This output is generally harmless and is generated by gevent patching the
  python thread module. If someone knows how to make it go away, patches are
  more than welcome :-)
