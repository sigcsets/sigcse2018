## SIGCSE 2018 Paper Types

Papers describe an educational research project, classroom experience, teaching technique, curricular initiative, or pedagogical tool. All papers should explicitly state their motivating questions, relate to relevant literature, and contain an analysis of the effectiveness of the interventions. Initial submissions must be anonymous. Note that an ABSTRACT SUBMISSION is now required for all papers and it is due a week before the full paper is due.

* CS Education Research papers should adhere to rigorous standards, describing hypotheses, methods, and results as is typical for research studies. These normally focus on topics relevant to computing education with emphasis on educational goals and knowledge units/topics relevant to computing education with statistical rigor; methods or techniques in computing education; evaluation of pedagogical approaches; and studies of the many different populations that are engaged in computing education, including (but not limited to) students, instructors, and issues of gender, diversity, and underrepresentation.

* Experience Reports and Tools papers should carefully describe a computer science education intervention and its context, and provide a rich reflection on what worked, what didnâ€™t, and why.  This track accepts experience reports, teaching techniques, and pedagogical tools. All papers in this track should provide enough detail so that others could adopt the new innovation.

* New curricula, programs, degrees and position papers. Papers about curricula, programs and degrees should describe the motivating context before the new initiative was undertaken, what it took to put the initiative into place, what the impact has been, and suggestions for others wishing to adopt it. Position papers are meant to engender fruitful academic discussion by presenting a defensible opinion about a CS education topic, substantiated with evidence.

## How Should The Paper Be Formatted?

Authors must submit ONLY an anonymized version of the paper. The goal of the anonymized version is to, as much as possible, allow the author(s) of the paper an unbiased review. The anonymized version should have ALL references to the authors removed (including author's names and affiliation plus identifying information within the body of the paper such as websites or related publications). Self-citations need not be removed if they are worded so that the reviewer doesn't know if the writer is citing himself/herself. That is, instead of writing "We reported on our first experiment in 2007 in a previous paper [1]", the writer might write "In 2007, an initial experiment was done in this area as reported in [1].

If the paper is accepted for the conference and for publication, authors will be asked to complete a camera-ready copy that will include all appropriate author names, citations, and references.

The paper is limited to a maximum of {{site.data.cfp.details[plural].limits}} and must adhere to ACM's publication guidelines:

<div class="text-center" style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;">
<a href="{{site.data.publishing.acmpubguidelines}}">Formatting requirements, MS Word template, and LaTeX template</a>
</div>

Please note that there are updated proceedings templates as of 2017.  Make sure you are using updated versions of the template.  We are using the `ACM_SigConf` template.

If your paper is accepted you will have a chance to modify your publication version before it is published.
