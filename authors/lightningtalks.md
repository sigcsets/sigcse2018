## What is a Lightning Talk?

Lightning talks describe works in progress, new and untested ideas, or
opportunities for collaborative work. The purpose of a lightning talk
can be to start a discussion, find collaborators, or receive input and
critique about an idea.

Proposals undergo review but not blind review.

## How Should The Proposal Be Formatted?

Lightning Talk proposals are to be provided in PDF format. The full proposal contains an abstract and a body that describes your Lightning Talk (as detailed below). The abstract needs to appear in two places: in the PDF proposal and in a text box on the submission page.

The full proposal is used for the review process only. If the proposal
is accepted, the abstract is the description that appears on the
Symposium website and in the Symposium program and proceedings. The
format for the proposal is as follows.

## Lightning Talk Proposal Format and Contents (limited to {{site.data.cfp.details["Lightning Talks"].limits}})

-   **Proposer**: Include name, affiliation, email address, and website address. You should expect most correspondence related to the conference to arrive via email. Please check your spam filter if you haven’t received an expected notification because the auto-responses generated by the conference software are sometimes blocked.

-   **Title**: A title for the Lightning Talk.

-   **Abstract**: A description of the Lightning Talk. The same abstract
    will also need to be submitted via a text box on the submission
    page. Please be sure that your description is accurate and that both
    submitted copies (here in the Lightning Talk Proposal, and in the
    submission text box) are exactly the same.

-   **Description**: Describe your talk in more detail. It will be helpful
    to reviewers to know why you are excited about the topic, and why
    you think others will be interested too. Lightning talks are
    expected to explore tentative or preliminary work, or even ideas for
    possible work. Presentations of mature work will not be considered.

## Lightning Talk Abstract

The abstract is the description of the Lightning talk that will appear
on the conference web pages. The description is limited to and must
match verbatim the abstract section of the Lightning talk Proposal. The
Lightning talk abstract must be submitted in plain text. The abstract
for an accepted proposal may contain a URL with more information.
(Abstracts of accepted Lightning talks can be edited in response to
reviews.)
