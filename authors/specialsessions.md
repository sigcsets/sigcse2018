## What Is A Special Session?

Special sessions are your opportunity to customize and experiment with
the SIGCSE conference format. Special sessions should NOT replicate
existing SIGCSE session formats (i.e., panels, paper presentations, and
poster sessions). They are scheduled in
standard conference spaces. Within these constraints, the form is yours
to design.

For example, a special session might be a tutorial or seminar, a
committee report, a curricular or accreditation forum, a rapid-fire
sequence of five-minute talks, or a hands-on demo of dance moves proven
to improve retention of CS material.

Possible topic areas include management of large classes, projects and
assignments, teaching computer science in K-12, experiments on
collaborative learning, report of an ACM committee addressing issues at
two-year colleges, or special issues arising when teaching computing
outside of North America.

Special session proposal review is NOT blind. Criteria used in reviewing
the proposals will include the likely level of interest in the session
and the suitability and feasibility of the proposed format to its topic.
If the proposal is accepted, all presenters listed in the special
session description will be required to register for the conference and
to participate in the session.

## How Should The Proposal Be Formatted?


The paper is limited to a maximum of {{site.data.cfp.details[plural].limits}} and must adhere to ACM's publication guidelines:

<div class="text-center" style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;">
<a href="{{site.data.publishing.acmpubguidelines}}">Formatting requirements, MS Word template, and LaTeX template</a>
</div>

The following modifications and exceptions apply:

-   Do not include an abstract. Instead, the first section should be
    titled Summary and should provide a summary of the session.

-   Subsequent sections should contain the following information:

-   Overall objective of the session: Describe the topic of the special
    session and explain how the session will be organized (e.g., as a
    committee report, tutorial, hands-on exercise, ...). Indicate why
    the proposed session is important.

-   Outline of the session: Organize this section by subtopics,
    activities, or a similar scheme. If more than one participant is
    involved, label each section of the outline with the name of the
    participant who will be presenting that section. Note that in the
    case of a committee report, the presenters might be a subset of the
    authors.

    We suggest that you allow at least 40 - 50% of the time for questions
and answers or other interaction with the attendees.

-   Expectations: State the intended audience. Indicate how much the
    session will cover and what the audience should learn. This is
    particularly important if your proposed special session is a
    tutorial. If feedback from the audience is desired, indicate how it
    will be elicited.

-   Suitability for a special session: Include a brief description that
    justifies the inclusion of this presentation as a special session.
    Explain why the proposed presentation is better suited for a special
    session than a paper or panel.

-   References where appropriate are encouraged, but not required. If
    they are included, they should be placed in a separate section
    titled References and should follow the formatting guidelines.

If accepted, the special session description will be allocated
{{site.data.cfp.details[plural].limits}} in the conference proceedings
and must adhere to the formatting guidelines specified above. To
facilitate the transition from proposal to camera-ready copy, it is
critical that authors adhere closely to the formatting specifications
and page limits.
