We have broken out submission guidelines by type. There are many ways to share the excellent work you are doing, and we would encourage you to consider all of them as you think about what would make the best vehicle for sharing your efforts with the larger community.

<div class="row">
    <div class="table-responsive">
      <table class="table">
          <tbody>
    {% for submission in site.data.cfp.master %}
      <tr>
        <td> <b>

        {% if submission.track == "track1" %}
           {{site.data.cfp.track1.date}}
        {% elsif submission.track == "track2" %}
            {{site.data.cfp.track2.date}}
