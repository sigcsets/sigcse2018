**ACM Author-Izer**

ACM is introducing the [ACM Author-Izer](http://www.acm.org/publications/acm-author-izer-service), a unique service that enables ACM authors to post links on either their own web page or institutional repository for visitors to download the definitive version of their articles from the ACM Digital Library at no charge. ACM Author-Izer also allows the dynamic display of download and citation statistics for each "authorized" article on the author’s personal page. By linking the author’s personal bibliography with the ACM Digital Library, downloads from the author’s site are captured in official ACM statistics, more accurately reflecting total usage. ACM Author-Izer also expands ACM’s reputation as an innovative “Green Path” publisher.

## Preparation of Final Copy


1. **Verify Conformance to All Formatting Guidelines:**

    **SIGCSE Guidelines** - Double-check that your submission adheres to the
      [ACM publication instructions]({{site.data.main.acmpubguidelines}}) and includes
       all required sections (i.e., Abstract, Categories & Subject Descriptors,
       General Terms, and Keywords), including details on the ACM Reference
       Guidelines.  These are the same formatting guidelines published when you
       submitted your paper/panel/special session, so hopefully you should not
       have to make any significant modifications. We encourage authors to use
       the [templates available on ACM's website](http://www.acm.org/sigs/pubs/proceed/template.html).
       LaTeX users should use [sig-alternate.cls](http://sheridanprinting.com/typedept/sig-alternate.cls)
       for papers and [sig-alt-release.cls](http://sheridanprinting.com/typedept/sig-alt-release.cls)
       for panels and special sessions.

    **Sheridan Publishing Guidelines** - Your final submission must also conform
    to the formatting rules on the publisher’s page for your submission type:

    * *Papers* - [publisher's web page for papers](http://www.sheridanprinting.com/typedept/sigcse.htm#insertCopyright)
    * *Panels & Special Sessions* - [publisher's web page for panels and special sessions](http://www.sheridanprinting.com/typedept/sigcse2.htm#insertCopyright)
    * *Workshops, Posters, Birds of a Feather, Demos and Lightning Talks* -
    [publisher's web page for these submissions](http://www.sheridanprinting.com/typedept/sigcse3.htm#insertCopyright)


2. **Insert copyright statement:**

    All papers, panels, and special sessions submissions must have a copyright or permission release statement inserted in the lower left of the first column.

    **Papers** - The publisher's page [publisher's web page for papers](http://www.sheridanprinting.com/typedept/sigcse.htm#insertCopyright) provides instructions on how to add the appropriate notice for papers.

    **Panels & Special Sessions** - The publisher's page [publisher's web page for panels and special sessions](http://www.sheridanprinting.com/typedept/sigcse2.htm#insertCopyright) provides instructions on how to add the appropriate notice for panels and special sessions.

    **Workshops, Posters, Birds of a Feather, Demos and Lightning Talks** - The publisher's page [for these submissions](http://www.sheridanprinting.com/typedept/sigcse3.htm#insertCopyright) provides instructions on how to add the appropriate notice for these submissions.

## Submission of Final Copy

**Deadline for papers**: Monday, December 1st, 2014

**Deadline for all other submission types**: Sunday, December 7th, 2014

Electronic Submissions Only!

THREE SUBMISSIONS ARE NECESSARY BY THE DEADLINE **-- one to the online database maintained by SIGCSE and two to the publisher. You must also submit a signed copyright release form or permission form depending on the submission type.** The instructions below will guide you in submitting the final copies to the online database and the publisher.

1. **Complete final editing and create a PDF file of your submission. Name your files correctly.**

    When your submission editing is complete, convert your paper into Adobe PDF format. Be sure to retain a copy of the source document(s), as well (e.g.,`.doc,.tex,.ps)` . Refer to our [hints on creating PDF documents]({{site.base}}/authors/creating_pdf.html). Name all of your files using your SIGCSE submission number and the lead author's last name (e.g., `fp309-turing.pdf, fp309-turing.doc`, etc.).

2. **Submit the PDF file of your submission to the SIGCSE online database.**

    Using the ID number and password assigned to your submission for review, submit the PDF file of the final copy to the SIGCSE online database by accessing the [Easy Chair site](https://www.Easy Chair.org/sigcse2015/track1/) and choosing Upload File. Log in using your submission ID and password and upload the pdf file.

    This step is necessary because we make the submissions available on-line (via links from the on-line program) prior to the start of the conference and well before they will be available from the ACM Digital Library.

3. **Submit the PDF and original source file(s) of your submission to the publisher of the proceedings.**

    The publisher is to receive (1) the PDF file and (2) a copy of the actual source file(s). The source file is needed to allow the publisher to extract text and data to produce the metadata for the [ACM Digital Library](http://www.acm.org/dl).

    Note that the publisher's website will be activated for uploading final submission files by November 12. You will receive one or more "Submission Reminder" emails from the publisher (from Lisa Tolles) that include a customized link for easy submission of your paper. Your paper identification number is in the subject of this email. Use this number if requested when you enter the publisher's site (it should match the first part of your file names; e.g., `fp309`).

    Submit two files (`.doc` and `.pdf`) if using Microsoft Word, or three files (`.tex, .ps`, and `.pdf`) if using LaTeX to the publisher [using the instructions on the publisher's website for your submission type](#finalcopy).

4. **After confirmation from the publisher, submit the signed ACM Copyright Form or Permission Form.**

    **For papers:** After submitting your document on the publisher's website, the publisher will send the contact author a confirmation message. After your paper has been processed, you will be emailed a link to an electronic ACM Copyright Form. Fill out and submit this form; [details are provided on the Sheridan website](http://www.sheridanprinting.com/typedept/sigcse.htm).

    **For panels and special sessions:** After submitting your document on the publisher's website, the publisher will send the contact author a confirmation message with a link to an ACM Permission Form. This process is entirely electronic, and [you should follow the instructions provided by Sheridan online](http://www.sheridanprinting.com/typedept/sigcse2.htm).

5. **Send email to the publications chair to indicate that you have completed all of the steps above.**

    Send email to the Publications Chair, Jian Zhang [sigcse2015-publications@rit.edu](mailto:sigcse2015-publications@rit.edu), with the subject line "**_type IDnumber name_**", where

    * **_type_** is one of "paper", "panel", or "special session"

    * **_IDnumber_** is the assigned submission ID number

    * **_name_** is the last name of the contact author of the submission

    For example, the subject line "**paper 309 Turing**" indicates that contact author Turing has completed the submission procedures for a paper with the submission ID number 309.

    This email will inform the Publications Chair, Jian Zhang, [sigcse2015-publications@rit.edu](mailto:sigcse2015-publications@rit.edu), that:

    * Your final copy has been updated in the SIGCSE online database

    * You have submitted both PDF and source file(s) to the publisher

    * You have completed the signed copyright or permission form and sent it to the publisher
