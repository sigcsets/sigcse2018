    Solving the biggest challenges in science, industry and society requires dramatic increases in computing efficiency. Today&rsquo;s technical computing applications must be modernized to unlock the potential of current and future hardware. Educating the next generation of programmers and researchers on parallel programming will help gain insights on how to execute their code faster and gain advantage of inherent system architecture.

    In this session, you will be able to directly apply modernization techniques to existing codes (such as the cardiac simulator, showing electrical signal propagation through the heart) in order to unlock the hardware capabilities. You&rsquo;ll utilize the full Intel® Parallel Studio XE suite of tools in order to discover how to best find and optimize performance bottlenecks in HPC applications, resolve parallelism issues, and scale to higher core counts.

  abstract: |
    CS courses often include the additional need to learn a complex set of support tools involving LMS's, discussion boards, e-book logins, homework systems, program submission systems, clickers, web links, online announcements, OS'es, IDEs, and other items, often involving poorly-designed UI's and workflows, making today's CS classes unnecessarily hard, and stressful. In this session, we will introduce: (1) zyBooks: Highly-interactive web-native CS learning material for nearly any lower-division CS course, featuring animations of challenging concepts, learning questions for engaged learning, and concise text for lucidity. Instructors can award points for completion, rearrange sections to match their syllabus, and add notes to content; (2) Our challenge activities ("homework"), fully integrated within each zyBook section, many algorithmically-generated, all auto-graded; (3) Our zyLabs system, "The easiest program submission and grading system on the planet", and seamlessly integratable with a zyBook, or usable standalone; and (4) Our user-experience focus that guides how the content and platform are designed, how we provide support and respond to feedback, and more. We will show how instructors use those items to eliminate non-essential complexity and help focus students on learning concepts and programming, and summarize research showing improved learning outcomes as well as happier, less-stressed students.

    __Physical Computing for CS Education with PXT__

    Thanks to Moore’s Law, embeddable microcontroller-based devices continue to get cheaper, faster, and include more integrated sensors and networking options. In 2016, the BBC and a host of technical partners, including Microsoft, delivered such a physical computing device, the BBC micro:bit, to every 5th grader in the UK. The non-profit Micro:bit Education Foundation ([http://microbit.org](http://microbit.org)), of which Microsoft is a founding partner, was recently created to take the micro:bit global. Over the last year, Microsoft has invested in a new web-based programming platform for physical computing, called PXT, with the micro:bit being the first target ([http://pxt.microbit.org](http://pxt.microbit.org)). Come hear about Microsoft’s plans for bringing physical computing to CS education across a wide range of devices.

    __Game-based Computing with Kodu and the BBC micro:bit__

    Microsoft’s Kodu Game Lab ([http://kodugamelab.com](http://kodugamelab.com)) is a game creation tool and visual programming environment for children. The micro:bit ([http://microbit.org](http://microbit.org)) is a card-sized microcomputer and sensor board designed to bring physical computing to kids and classrooms. What if we were to combine the two? In this session you will create a Kodu game controlled by the micro:bit, and you will learn first-hand the different ways Kodu and the micro:bit work together to blend virtual- and real-world computing.

  abstract: |
    This session will provide an introduction to ABET as the leading
    organization in the world that provides accreditation of undergraduate
    computing programs. ABET accredits programs in computer science,
    information systems and information technology, and provides a flexible
    infrastructure for accrediting programs in emerging computing disciplines.
    The session will discuss ABET’s contributions to these academic computing
    disciplines and to the standardization of computing education. The session
    will also articulate the benefits of obtaining program accreditation in
    the computing field.

    ABET continues to evolve its computing
    accreditation criteria as the computing disciplines evolve. During 2016,
    ABET provided initial approval to new computing accreditation criteria,
    that--in final form--will be rolled out over the next several years for
    both new accreditations and re-accreditations. These criteria, which are
    currently undergoing public review, include revisions to the general
    computing criteria and to program criteria for computer science,
    information technology and information systems. This session will discuss
    the new criteria and provide an opportunity for audience feedback to be
    considered in the final revision that is currently in progress.
    ABET is also developing new program criteria to accredit cybersecurity
    programs. This session will provide a progress report on that effort and
    will provide an opportunity for audience feedback on the proposed
    cybersecurity program criteria.
