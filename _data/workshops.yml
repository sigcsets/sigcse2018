  title: Programming for the Humanities – a Whirlwind Tour of Assignments for the CS1 Course
  room: 301
  presenters: Brian Kokensparger and Wade Peyou, Creighton University
  abstract: Digital Humanities (DH) seeks to use computer technology and algorithms to assist and support traditional humanities research methods. Particularly in smaller institutions, CS instructors are sometimes tasked with modifying CS1 courses to teach introductory programming for the Digital Humanities. Training computer science students in DH programming methods may also have some additional benefits, such as bringing more women into computing, and helping in the recruitment and retention of CS students overall. In both higher education and secondary education settings, DH projects may also provide Community-Based Service-Learning opportunities that will give students experiential learning opportunities not provided in industry. The presenters have developed six assignments in Python that are oriented towards DH topics while still providing CS students solid experiences in core programming concepts. This workshop introduces the participants to five of the assignments and gives them immersive abbreviated experiences in each. The topics include Computing Change over Time (calculating burials in a historic cemetery), Visualization of Change over Time (visualizing the burials in the historic cemetery), Textual Analysis (finding word frequencies and “stop words” in public domain texts), Stylometrics (comparing measured features of graphic images), and Social Network Analysis (analyzing extended relationships in historic social circles). A balance of direct coding experience and discussion of gotchas and best practices in classroom management will give workshop participants confidence in offering and managing these assignments in their own classrooms. Participants should bring a laptop/keying-friendly mobile device that has a Python 3.x IDE already installed, and some familiarity with the Python language.

  title: "Playing to Learn: Using Hands-on Activities to Boost Learning in Computer Science"
  room: 322
  presenters: Karen Anewalt and Jennifer Polack, University of Mary Washington
  abstract: Active learning techniques are widely reported to enhance student learning and increase student engagement. They provide a powerful tool to reinforce course concepts and allow students with diverse backgrounds and learning styles to master essential concepts efficiently. In addition, many students and faculty find hands-on activities to be fun and memorable. Workshop attendees will participate in five hands-on activities covering concepts that are commonly taught in introductory programming courses including variable declaration, object instantiation, parameter passing, memory management, and the software development process. Workshop participants will be challenged to create additional activities to be included in an online repository. Instructors of introductory programming courses at the undergraduate and K12 level who are interested in creating memorable learning experiences using free and low-cost props will find this participatory workshop to be relevant to their teaching. Come ready to play!

  title: Introducing Secure Coding in Undergraduate (CS0, CS1, and CS2) and High School (AP Computer Science A) Programming Courses
  room: 303
  presenters: Siddharth Kaza and Blair Taylor, Towson University
  abstract: The ACM CS 2013 curriculum includes Information Assurance and Security as a pervasive knowledge area, the ACM Community College curricular guidelines, CSTransfer2017, places great emphasis on cybersecurity as well. However, introducing security in introductory programming courses is challenging because of lack of appropriate teaching resources and training. This workshop will provide a well-tested strategy for introducing secure coding concepts in CS0, CS1, CS2, and AP CS A classes. We will introduce attendees to secure coding through hands-on exercises, and provide self-contained, lab-based modules designed to be injected into CS0-CS2 with minimal impact on the course (www.towson.edu/securityinjections). Participants will be encouraged to bring in their own syllabus and labs to modify to include learning objectives focused on cybersecurity based on ACM and CAE guidelines. Laptop recommended.

  title: "Designing Empirical Education Research Studies (DEERS): Creating an Answerable Research Question"
  room: 318
  presenters: Mark Sherriff, University of Virginia; Sarah Heckman, North Carolina State University; and Jeffrey Carver, University of Alabama
  abstract: One of the most important, and difficult, aspects of starting an education research project is identifying an interesting, answerable, repeatable, measurable, and appropriately scoped research question. The lack of a valid research question reduces the potential impact of the work and could result in wasted effort. The goal of this workshop is to help educational researchers get off on the right foot by defining such a research question. This workshop is part of the larger Designing Empirical Education Research Studies (DEERS) project, which consists of an ongoing series of workshops in which researcher cohorts work with experienced empirical researchers to design, implement, evaluate, and publish empirical work in computer science education. In addition to instruction on the various aspects of good research questions, DEERS alumni will join us to mentor attendees in development of their own research questions in small group breakout sessions. At the end of the workshop, attendees will leave with a valid research question that can then be the start for designing a research study. Attendees will also receive information on how to apply to attend the full summer workshop, where they can fully flesh out the empirical study design, and join a DEERS research cohort. More information about DEERS can be found at http://empiricalcsed.org.

  title: "The Nand to Tetris Course: Building a Modern Computer from First Principles"
  room: 320
  presenters: Shimon Schocken, IDC Herzliya
  abstract: We present a full semester course in which students build a complete computer system - hardware and software - from the ground up. Also known as "Nand to Tetris", the course is presently taught at 100+ universities, and is listed in Coursera's top-rated courses. The course synthesizes many abstractions, algorithms, and data structures learned in CS courses, and makes them concrete by building a complete computer system from first principles. The methodology is based on guiding students through a set of 12 homework assignments that gradually construct and unit-test a simple hardware platform and a modern software hierarchy, yielding a surprisingly powerful computer system. We’ll start the workshop by demonstrating some interactive computer games running on this platform. The hardware projects are done in a simple hardware description language and a hardware simulator supplied by us. The software projects (assembler, VM, compiler and OS) can be done in any language, using API's and test programs supplied by us. The result is a general-purpose computer system, simulated on the student's PC. The course is completely self-contained, requiring only programming as a pre-requisite. Also, it is highly modular, and can be viewed as a set of 12 exciting, stand-along homework assignments. The course and the workshop assume no specific knowledge of, or bent for, computer organization/architecture, and are aimed at any instructor who wishes to strengthen his or her courses with engaging programming projects and with a hands-on understanding of how modern computer systems work, and how they are built.

  title: Programming web services on the cloud with Node.js
  room: 302
  presenters: Ariel Ortiz, Tecnologico de Monterrey, Campus Estado de México
  abstract: Node.js is one of the hottest open source web platforms currently available. It's used by companies like PayPal, DowJones, Walmart, Netflix, and Yahoo. Node.js allows you to use JavaScript to write all kinds of network servers in just a few lines of code, definitely easier than using other platforms based on languages such as C++, C# or Java. If you know how to use JavaScript on the front end (i.e., the browser), it's a breeze to use it on the back end (i.e., the server). This workshop is aimed at CS instructors that wish to teach students how to use and write RESTful web services (a.k.a. web APIs) using Node.js on a cloud platform. The only thing you need is a computer with a modern web browser and a Wi-Fi connection. Participants will use the free service provided by the Cloud9 platform (https://c9.io/) to learn how to write scalable web services using Node.js, the Express web framework, MySQL, and Ajax via jQuery. Web services allows us to build powerful web based applications using data from multiple online sources. And, by using a cloud platform, we have all our tools readily available through a web browser, thus eliminating the hassle related to installing a complete and fully functional web development environment. Participants are expected to have a working knowledge of JavaScript, SQL and HTML. Additional information available at http://node.arielortiz.info/ Laptop required.

  title: Successfully Engaging Early Undergraduates in CS Research
  room: 314
  presenters: Christine Alvarado, University of California San Diego; and Neil Spring, University of Maryland
  abstract: Engaging undergraduates in research has been shown to improve retention, increase students’ sense of science identity, and increase the chances that they will continue to graduate school. Yet many undergraduates don’t participate in research until very late in their undergraduate program, while the majority of undergraduates don’t participate in research at all. On the other hand, many faculty are eager and willing to do research with undergraduates, but are unsure how to mentor and supervise them, particularly early undergraduates who may have very little specific technical knowledge and skills. This workshop will provide participants with concrete skills and techniques for engaging early undergraduates (freshmen and sophomores) in real research projects, and, if desired, for developing or growing a department-wide early undergraduate research program. Participants will engage in hands-on activities where they will learn how to develop appropriately scoped research projects, manage and mentor early undergraduates successfully, and teach core research skills like reading research papers and writing research proposals. The workshop will also cover how to mitigate specific challenges faced by students from groups underrepresented in computer science. The materials presented in this workshop are based on the successful Early Research Scholars Program at UC San Diego (ersp.ucsd.edu), which is entering its fourth year, and engages 40 second-year students per year--the majority of whom are women and/or students from underrepresented racial or ethnic groups--in academic-year research apprenticeships.

  title: LEGO-based Active Learning Exercises for Teaching Software Development
  room: 321
  presenters: Stan Kurkovsky, Central Connecticut State University; and Stephanie Ludi, University of North Texas
  abstract: LEGO is a construction toy familiar to many students. Creating software, regardless of scale, is often similar to building with tangible objects, such as houses or bridges--an analogy that is often used in the classroom. In this workshop, we will show how to use LEGO bricks as a surrogate representing the lines of code, software objects, or other artifacts in the process of constructing software systems in order to better explain these concepts. LEGO-based analogies and case studies enacted as hands-on exercises for student teams help develop a better understanding of the underlying concepts, while keeping students deeply engaged in the course material. This workshop is intended for faculty teaching undergraduate and graduate courses focusing on software development, software engineering, and related concepts. This workshop will also benefit other educators looking for ways to supplement their courses with engaging and playful hands-on activities aimed to strengthen the teamwork, oral communication, problem solving, and design skills of students. We will practice several hands-on LEGO-based activities during the workshop. Specific topics of these activities will include change management and object-oriented interfaces, as well as activities specific to the phases of software development. Workshop participants will learn about other LEGO-based activities that focus on a broad range of topics including requirements engineering, architectural design, and software dependability. A laptop is not required for this workshop. This work is supported in part by the National Science Foundation Awards 1611905, 1709244 and a 2015 ACM SIGCSE Special Project grant.
