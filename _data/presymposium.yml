- name: Strategies for Integrating Driverless Cars into the Computing Curricula
  date: Wednesday, March 8, 1:00pm-5:00pm
  room: 603
  cost: Free
  max: No Max
  blurb: |
    Driverless cars are a feat of engineering and computer science. While not
    yet a commercial reality, this topic is not only popular with
    students (and faculty) but also provides a rich environment to explore a
    plethora of key computer science topics. These topics range from the
    algorithmically technical (e.g. obstacle recognition, inter-vehicle
    communication), to those of algorithmic fairness (e.g. load balancing
    versus priority), to those of professional and computational ethics (e.g.
    an unavoidable Sophie’s Choice).

    This workshop aims to bring together experts in driverless cars,
    algorithms, ethics and algorithmic fairness with a community of interested
    CS educators to discuss and work through topics, recommended approaches
    and even educational modules/exercises in driverless cars for the
    undergraduate computing curricula.

    This workshop is sponsored by ACM SIGCAS (Special Interest Group on
    Computers and Society) and is free and open to the SIGCSE community.

  room: 612
  cost: Free
  max: No Max
  blurb: |
    This event, led by the ACM CCECC (Committee for Computing Education in
    Community Colleges), will engage participants in exploring and using ACM’s
    curricular guidance for associate-degree transfer programs in Computer
    Science in programs at their own colleges.

    In 2015, under the auspices of the ACM Education Board the CCECC began
    updating the ACM Computing Curricula 2009: Guidelines for Associate-Degree
    Transfer Curriculum in Computer Science with inclusion of contemporary
    cybersecurity concepts. To this end, the CCECC established a task force of
    community college educators to review the ACM/IEEE Computer Science
    Curricula 2013 (CS2013) and identify foundational material in CS2013 that
    is appropriate for the first two years of a computer science baccalaureate
    degree.  To further inform the guidance, the CCECC administered surveys to
    a global audience of computer science educators to solicit input related
    to CS2013 knowledge areas (KAs) and knowledge units (KUs) and on
    cybersecurity topics which are appropriate for associate-degree computer
    science transfer programs.  The guidance has been through two rounds of
    public review and comment, and will be in near-final form by SIGCSE 2017.

    During this affiliated event, participants will receive an overview of the
    ACM guidelines and will engage directly in exploring how the guidelines
    can be used at their own college for program creation, review,
    articulation, and other purposes, by aligning their computer science
    program to the ACM guidelines and by using an online correlation tool
    developed by the CCECC.

  blurb: |
    This event, led by members of the ACM Joint Task Force (JTF) for
    Cybersecurity Education (csec2017.org), will engage participants in a
    direct dialog concerning the development of curricular guidance.
    Specifically, this session will focus on ensuring that the curricular
    guidance is being developed to support worldwide adoption and to foster
    instructional relationships industry stakeholders and training providers.
    The JTF is seeking valuable input from the SIGCSE community in shaping the
    next version of the guidelines. During the event, an overview of the
    curricular guidance straw version will be presented, and participants
    will actively engage in exploring how the guidelines can be improved/used
    for course and program creation, review, and articulation, as well as for
    other purposes not yet conceived. The purpose of this session is not to
    discuss the content of the curricular volume, that discussion will occur
    during the JTF special session scheduled for the main SIGCSE program.
    Rather, this session will provide an opportunity for participants to
    address the larger context and focus specifically on the broad
    stakeholder audience.

    The Joint Task Force on Cybersecurity Education (JTF) was chartered by
    the ACM Education Board in September 2015 with the expressed purpose of
    developing comprehensive, undergraduate curricular guidance in
    cybersecurity education to support future program development and
    associated educational efforts. The JTF is a collaboration among major
    international computing societies: Association for Computing Machinery
    (ACM), IEEE Computer Society (IEEE-CS), Association for Information
    Systems Special Interest Group on Security (AIS SIGSEC), and the
    International Federation for Information Processing Technical Committee
    on Information Security Education (IFIP WG 11.8). The JTF grew out of
    the foundational efforts of the Cyber Education Project (CEP).

- name: Department Chairs Roundtable

  room: 616-617
  cost: $125
  max: No Max
  blurb: |
    What are the challenges that Department Chairs face? How would you design
    the ideal Department Chair? What are the features of a great Department
    Chair? What are the issues in having a poor Department Chair? The summary
    at the end of this article demonstrates the challenges that face anyone
    that takes on this critical role.

    If you are a new Chair, an experienced Chair, thinking about becoming a
    Chair, or if you have stories to tell about awesome or terrible Department
    Chairs, then you should participate in this roundtable. The discussions
    and insights from this Roundtable should improve the quality of the
    Department Chair experience: whether you are a Chair or not, this session
    will be helpful in navigating your academic career.

    The Roundtable will feature a panel of diverse and experienced Department
    Chairs to lead a series of design charrettes . The charrettes will tackle
    topics such as the significant administrative and personnel issues that
    chairs must handle; leadership and management styles, time management,
    legal issues, establishing priorities, and communication.

    The final hour of the Roundtable will have a special focus on how to
    encourage the adoption of innovative teaching practices. Changes in
    attitudes toward teaching and learning are intertwined with the
    availability of new technologies that challenge faculty to change the
    way they teach. How can the Department Chair provide an organizational
    climate that encourages and rewards innovation in CS education?

    Many people don’t appreciate the many duties and roles that it part of
    the Department Chair experience. Here is a summary of the most common
    expectations from a Department Chair:

    +   **Leader**: visionary, internal advocate, internal intermediary,
        external liaison, curriculum leader, role model. The Chair should
        be a transformational leader capable of creating space for change
        and generating consensus among the faculty.

    +   **Administrator**: fiscal overseer, schedule coordinator, report,
        generator, staff supervisor. The Chair monitors the department budget
        to ensure that the department’s work is done and that allocations are
        not overspent. This role increasingly requires the Chair to find
        creative ways to extend the budgets, including external fund raising.

    +   **Personal facilitator**: counselor, coach, mediator, climate
        regulator. The Chair needs to be accessible, establish relationships,
        and be willing to listen to concerns to create an environment that
        will encourage faculty productivity and harmony.

    +   **Resource developer**: faculty recruiter, faculty mentor, faculty
        evaluator, resource provider. The Chair hires new department faculty,
        provides faculty with professional development opportunities and
        mentoring to ensure their professional success and retention;
        provides evaluations for annual merit raises, retention, promotion,
        and tenure decisions; and finds resources that faculty need to do
        their jobs.

  date: Friday, March 10, 7:00am-8:30am
  room: 6B
  cost: Free
  max: No Max
  blurb: |
    Within the last year, new major versions of both the BlueJ and Greenfoot
    environments have been released. These versions bring some major
    enhancements and features to both systems, most importantly the addition
    of a new language, Stride.
    Incorporating characteristics from both text-based and block-based systems,
    Stride offers novel edit interactions with the potential to significantly
    benefit novice learners of programming. Designed with a transition to
    text-based systems in mind as a progression path, it provides an ideal
    entry point or stepping stone from block-based programming systems.
    In addition to the new editor, both systems offer a range of other
    enhancements, such as continuous edit-time error checking, improved error
    message display, GIT support in BlueJ and the ability to develop JavaFX
    applications.
    We will introduce and demonstrate the new features of both systems,
    and (because it’s an early start) provide an informal buffet breakfast
    for attendees.
