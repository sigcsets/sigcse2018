<div align="center"><strong>The 49th ACM Technical Symposium on Computer Science Education</strong></div>
<div align="center"><strong>February 21 – 24, 2018, Baltimore, Maryland, USA, http://sigcse2018.sigcse.org</strong></div>
<p>

<p>
The SIGCSE Technical Symposium is a forum for educators and researchers to share new results and insights
around developing, implementing, or evaluating computing programs, curricula, and courses. We invite colleagues
from around the world to contribute to, review for, and attend SIGCSE 2018. We encourage you to share your new
ideas for computing syllabi, laboratories, teaching, pedagogy, and education research at all levels of instruction.
</p>
<p>
Our 2018 theme “ CS for All” highlights our common goal to equitably engage all people to learn computer science,
since computing and computational thinking are increasingly important literacies for living in the 21st century. We are
particularly interested in broadening participation and diversity, K­12 and novice learners, improved and scalable
pedagogies, leveraging data and analytics to improve learning, peer learning and instruction, novel outreach, events
and engagement strategies, involving students in solving social and global challenges, advanced CS topics, and
education research. SIGCSE encourages multiple ways of sharing ideas, including papers, panels, special sessions,
workshops, BoFs, posters, demos, lightning talks, and the ACM Student Research Competition.
</p>
<p>
<h3>PAPERS</h3> (6 pp. max; 25 min. presentation) <br>Papers describe an educational research project, classroom experience,
teaching technique, curricular initiative, or pedagogical tool. All papers should explicitly state their motivating
questions, relate to relevant literature, and contain an analysis of the effectiveness of the interventions. Initial
submissions must be anonymous. <strong>Note that an ABSTRACT SUBMISSION is now required for all papers and it is
due a week before the full paper is due.</strong>
<ul>
<li>CS Education Research papers should adhere to rigorous standards, describing hypotheses, methods,
and results as is typical for research studies. These normally focus on topics relevant to computing
education with emphasis on educational goals and knowledge units/topics relevant to computing education
with statistical rigor; methods or techniques in computing education; evaluation of pedagogical approaches;
and studies of the many different populations that are engaged in computing education, including (but not
limited to) students, instructors, and issues of gender, diversity, and underrepresentation.</li>
<li>Experience Reports and Tools papers should carefully describe a computer science education intervention
and its context, and provide a rich reflection on what worked, what didn’t, and why. This track accepts
experience reports, teaching techniques, and pedagogical tools. All papers in this track should provide
enough detail so that others could adopt the new innovation.</li>
<li>New curricula, programs, degrees and position papers . Papers about curricula, programs and degrees
should describe the motivating context before the new initiative was undertaken, what it took to put the
initiative into place, what the impact has been, and suggestions for others wishing to adopt it . Position
papers are meant to engender fruitful academic discussion by presenting a defensible opinion about a CS
education topic, substantiated with evidence.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
<h3>PANELS</h3> (2 pp. max; 75 min.) <br>Panels present multiple perspectives on a specific topic. Panel proposals include a
topic description, panelists, affiliations, panelist position statements, and a plan for audience participation.
</p>
<p>
<h3>SPECIAL SESSIONS</h3> (2 pp. max; 75 min.) <br>Special sessions are your opportunity to design a unique 75­-minute
session in a standard conference space, but distinct from papers, panels, posters, or BoFs.</p>
<p>
<h3>WORKSHOPS</h3> (2 pp. max; 3 hours) <br>Workshops engage participants in learning new techniques and technologies
designed to foster education, scholarship, and collaboration. Proposals must include an abstract, intended audience
and size, and specify power/A/V/equipment/space needs. Workshops do not conflict with the technical sessions.</p>
<p>
<h3>NIFTY ASSIGNMENTS</h3> (1 p. max; 15 min. presentation during Nifty session) <br>Nifty Assignments promote and share
successful assignment ideas with enough materials available for others to adopt and adapt for their use. Proposals
must include a short writeup describing the assignment, target population, strength and weaknesses, and what
computing concept it teaches.</p>
<p>

<h3>BIRDS OF A FEATHER (BoF)</h3> (1 p. max; 50 min., no A/V) <br>BoFs provide an environment for colleagues with similar
interests to meet for informal discussions. A/V equipment will not be provided for BoFs.</p>
<p>

<h3>POSTERS</h3> (2 pp. max; 2 hours) <br>Posters describe CS education materials or research, particularly works in progress.
Posters enable one­on­one discussion with conference attendees. Prepared handouts are encouraged.</p>
<p>

<h3>DEMOS</h3> (2 pp. max; 90 min.) <br>Demos showcase the relevance, potential, and innovation of a tool and allow time for
discussion with its creator in the exhibition hall. Proposals include an abstract and specify power/A/V/space needs.</p>
<p>

<h3>LIGHTNING TALKS</h3> (500 words max; 5 min.) <br>Lightning talks describe works in progress, new and untested ideas, or
opportunities for collaborative work. Talks are an excellent way to spark discussions and get feedback on an idea.</p>
<p>

<h3>ACM STUDENT RESEARCH COMPETITION (SRC)</h3> (2 pp. max; 3­hour poster) <br>Undergraduate and graduate student
ACM members are invited to submit individual research contributions from all areas of computer science.</p>
<p>

<h3>PRE­SYMPOSIUM EVENTS</h3> (2 pp. max; 4 or 8 hours) <br>Affiliated organizations are invited to submit proposals for
events, including: target audience, # participants, duration, topic, schedule, power/A/V/space needs, and organizers.</p>
<p>
