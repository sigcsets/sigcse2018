In keeping with the [ACM Anti Harassment Policy](http://www.acm.org/sigs/volunteer_resources/officers_manual/anti-harassment-policy), SIGCSE advocates the following:

The open exchange of ideas and the freedom of thought and expression are central to the aims and goals of SIGCSE; these require an environment that recognizes the inherent worth of every person and group, that fosters dignity, understanding, and mutual respect, and that embraces diversity. The ACM Code of Ethics embraces the “values of equality, tolerance, respect for others, and the principles of equal justice”. For these reasons, SIGCSE is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience.

**Harassment is unwelcome or hostile behavior**, including speech that intimidates, creates discomfort, or interferes, in a SIGCSE event. Harassment in any form, including but not limited to **harassment based on race, gender, religion, age, color, national origin, ancestry, disability, sexual orientation, or gender identity, will not be tolerated**. Harassment includes the use of gratuitous language or sexual imagery in public presentations and displays, degrading verbal comments, deliberate intimidation, stalking, harassing photography or recording, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Conference participants violating these standards may be sanctioned, expelled from the conference or asked not to attend future conferences or conference events, at the discretion of the conference organizers and the SIG executive committee.

If you believe you have been harassed or notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, you are encouraged to report the incident in confidence to either of the conference chairs.

<h2>Conference Policies</h2>

SIGCSE reserves the right to reject any materials that we find offensive or inappropriate, such as politically charged material, and will not refund any expenses incurred.


<h2>SIGCSE Conference Presenter Substitution<br> and No-Show Policy</h2>

Submission of a paper, panel, special session, workshop, poster, working group, birds-of-feather or anything else for presentation at a SIGCSE conference (SIGCSE, ITiCSE, ICER) means that if the proposal is accepted at least one of the authors will register for the conference and attend the conference to "present" the proposal. If drastic unforeseen circumstances prevent the presenting author from attending and presenting, it is his/her responsibility to arrange a qualified substitute presenter. If a substitution is necessary, the conference program committee chairs should be notified as early as possible with all pertinent details. At their discretion and dependent upon circumstances, the program chairs may elect to inform upcoming SIGCSE conference program chairs about the substitution (or the failure to provide a substitute). This could jeopardize the acceptance of proposals from those involved for the upcoming conferences. In extreme cases, the SIGCSE Board may send a letter to the parent institution of a delinquent author expressing displeasure. This policy was approved by the SIGCSE Board in June of 2008.
