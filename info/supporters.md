<p>  The Special Interest Group in Computer Science Education of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM SIGCSE) is a community of approximately 2,600 people whom, in addition to their specialization within computing, have a strong interest in the quality of computing education. The SIGCSE Symposium is the flagship conference of the organization and is regularly attended by more than 1,200 people. Conference attendees are looking for new ideas, textbooks to support their courses, and materials to improve the effectiveness of their teaching. Course related software and hardware systems are of great interest. With the ever-changing face of computing education attendees will want to find out about the latest innovations in content delivery, classroom management and instructional support.
</p>
<p>  In addition to selecting the textbooks and support materials for their courses, conference attendees  influence the choice of computing equipment for their laboratories as well as for their departments. They select the tools that support teaching and their own scholarly work. They also determine what languages will be used in their courses and what compilers and development environments will be installed. These professionals set aside the time of the Symposium to review what is available and make their choices for the coming years. This is the most efficient way to interact with the most active teaching faculty in computing and information science.
