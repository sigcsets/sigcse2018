## The Evolution Before the Revolution
As founder of the original Computer Science for All (CS4All)
initiative in the Chicago Public Schools, Brenda Darden
Wilkerson set the standard for integrating computer science
classes into the curriculum for every student. Now, she’s leading
the charge to break down barriers for women and members of
other underrepresented minorities in the tech industry. She argues
that, while many administrators and community leaders see
CS4All as merely a key component of a new core curriculum, CS
educators are actually sowing the seeds of the next workplace
revolution. In this inspirational keynote, Brenda will share the
ways that educators on the front lines of this inclusive movement
can expect to reap the fruits of their labor —  not just
professionally, but personally — in surprising ways. And she’ll
spotlight the historic role of women, and people of color, in
technology and computer science, offering examples that will
better allow us all to reclaim our rightful seats at the table.
