The SIGCSE Board is pleased to announce the opening of applications for the 2016 Travel Grant Program.  The Travel Grant Program was established through a generous donation by Henry Walker to support faculty and teachers who have not yet had an opportunity to attend the SIGCSE Symposium. We anticipate funding at least five awards for the 2016 Symposium.

### To Apply

Faculty and teachers who have never attended the Symposium and do not have institutional support to attend are encouraged to apply for the program using an online form:

<div class="text-center" style="margin-bottom: 20px;">

<a href="http://www.jotform.us/form/51176551292152">http://www.jotform.us/form/51176551292152</a>

</div>

  
Completion of the form requires some basic demographic information, a SIGCSE member number, and a two-part essay that includes a brief description of how attendance will benefit the applicant and how the applicant plans to share what he/she has learned with his/her community.

Applications for the 2016 Symposium must be received by **October 31, 2015** to be considered.  Due to reviewing constraints, no late applications will be accepted. Please encourage faculty and teachers at your institution who could benefit from Symposium attendance to apply.  More information about the program and the application process can be found on the Travel Grant Program page: [http://sigcse.org/travelGrant](http://sigcse.org/travelGrant)
