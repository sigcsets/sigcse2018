This year, we are at the [Baltimore Convention Center (WSCC)](http://www.bccenter.org/floorplans.php?id=12) and we are working with four conference hotels in Baltimore, MD.

This page will contain everything you need for registration, reserving a room, obtaining visas, and finding a roommate. For now, we want to make sure that rate information is available early to attendees.

<div class="row" style="margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;">

SIGCSE 2018 takes place February 21-24, 2018.

As always, we encourage attendees to register early. This helps us with our planning, and in return, you get lower registration rates!


{% if site.data.sigcse.registration.isopen %}
<!--<div class="alert alert-success text-center">
<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-home" aria-hidden="true"></span> <a href="{{site.data.sigcse.registration.url}}">Register now!</a>
</div>-->
{% else %}
{% callout info %}
  Online registration is closed. Registration is now only available on-site.
{% endcallout %}
{% endif %}

<p>Also, if you are not currently a SIGCSE member, you should <b>consider joining at the same time that you register</b> for the conference. Professionals can <b>save between $30 and $55</b>, while both professionals and students <b>save time</b> by not having to fill out a separate membership form.  The <a href="http://sigcse.org/sigcse/membership/benefits">benefits of SIGCSE membership</a>  are too numerous to list here, but they include the quarterly publications <i>ACM Inroads</i> and the <i>SIGCSE Bulletin</i>, free access to SIGCSE publication archives, access to the SIGCSE-ANNOUNCE and SIGCSE-MEMBERS mailing lists, and the opportunity to network within a community of computing professionals.</p>

Professionals should choose one of the "Non-member joining SIGCSE" registration categories, which are <b>less expensive</b> than the Non-member category. Students simply choose the "Student Non-member" registration category, and then don't opt-out of the included membership (that's right -- it couldn't be much easier). Alternatively, you could <a href="http://sigcse.org/sigcse/membership">join SIGCSE</a>, wait for your membership number, and then register for the conference using the "Member" category.

But wait! There's more! <b>Student volunteers</b> get reimbursed for their conference registration, so they actually <b>get free SIGCSE membership</b> when they join at the same time that they register for the conference. Important: to get this benefit, students must register as volunteers through a system separate from conference registration.

### Cancellation Policy

Cancellation requests must be made by February 7, 2018. A processing fee of US$100 will be assessed. Regrettably cancellations received after that date cannot be honored. The conference committee recognizes that sometimes last minute cancellations can't be avoided due to weather, travel disruptions, and/or health issues. However, the conference incurs expenses for which it is liable based on registration counts on February 8, 2018. Therefore, no refunds are possible after February 7, 2018 for any reason. Attendees are strongly advised to purchase travel insurance to cover their non-refundable expenses.

### Regarding Visas

ACM is able to provide visa support letters to attendees as well as authors with accepted papers, posters, or members of the conference committee.

For Visa support letters, please email all requests to the Office of SIG Services at [supportletters@acm.org](mailto:supportletters@acm.org).  The information below should be included with the request:

* Name (as it appears on attendee’s passport) and 
* Mailing address
* The name of the conference attendees is registering for
* Attendee’s registration confirmation number (if available) OR
* Authors may indicate their paper title. Speakers can provide the title of their talk.
* Include a fax number or email address of where letter can be sent

Those requesting a letter should allow 7-10 business days to receive it. All requests are handled in the order they are received.

## Find a Roommate!

You can also use the [SIGCSE roommate database](http://sigcse.rit.edu/roommates/) to find someone to room with. This is the preferred database of SIGCSE members around the world for finding roommates at the SIGCSE Technical Symposium. Honest.
