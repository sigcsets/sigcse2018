showTitle: true

The SIGCSE 2018 Technical Symposium is saddened by the situation taking place in Texas and Louisiana as a result of the Hurricane Harvey. We encourage all members of the SIGCSE community to find a way to help those in need in any way they possibly can.
 
We are conscious of how the situation in Texas/Louisiana might be disproportionally affecting some members of our extended family.
 
To that end, if anyone directly impacted by Hurricane Harvey is considering participating in SIGCSE and is in need of extra time because of being directly affected by these events, do not hesitate to reach out to us - [program@sigcse2018.org](mailto:program@sigcse2018.org).
 
We will work with you to try to accommodate your participation within the timeline of events for the conference.
