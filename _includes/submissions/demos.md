Demos provide a way to showcase an educational tool or project in a live setting. Not designed to be sales pitches, demonstrations are a way for the community to see the relevance, potential and innovation of the tool and allow time for discussion with its creator. Proposals must specify any power, A/V equipment, space, or other needs. Demos will will occur during break periods at a designated space in the exhibition hall.
