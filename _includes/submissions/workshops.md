 Workshops offer participants opportunities to learn new techniques and
technologies designed to foster education, scholarship, and
collaborations. A workshop proposal should be {{site.data.cfp.details["Workshops"].limits}}. Proposals must specify equipment needs (e.g.,
participant-supplied laptops, room configurations, network requirements, and A/V equipment)
and any limitation on the number of participants. Workshops are
scheduled for a three-hour session and do not conflict with the
technical sessions.
