## SIGCSE 2018 Review Process for Workshop Proposals

Workshops provide an in-depth review of, or introduction to, a topic of interest, and should provide participants with materials and/or ideas that are immediately useful in the classroom. To this end, workshop presenters should provide participants with handouts outlining the workshop material.

Workshop proposals undergo review but not blind review. Proposals are evaluated for relevance, anticipated interest, quality, and availability of appropriate facilities. Authors may want to review the list of last yearâ€™s accepted SIGCSE workshops prior to submitting a proposal.

SIGCSE workshop proposals are reviewed using EasyChair. Authors submit a workshop proposal by Sept. 1, 2017. Assigned reviewers submit their anonymous reviews through EasyChair by the review deadline (Sept. 20, 2017), making a recommendation along with a rationale using the conference review form in EasyChair.  Each workshop proposal is assigned to at least three reviewers.

Dates for notification of acceptance and camera-ready submission can be found on the detail page for each specific submission type.
