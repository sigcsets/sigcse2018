## SIGCSE 2018 Review Process for Special Session Proposals

Special sessions are your opportunity to customize and experiment with the SIGCSE conference format. Special sessions should NOT replicate existing SIGCSE session formats (i.e., panels, paper presentations, and poster sessions). They are scheduled in standard conference spaces. Within these constraints, the form is yours to design.

For example, a special session might be a tutorial or seminar, a committee report, a curricular or accreditation forum, a rapid-fire sequence of five-minute talks, or a hands-on demo of dance moves proven to improve retention of CS material.

Possible topic areas include management of large classes, projects and assignments, teaching computer science in K-12, experiments on collaborative learning, report of an ACM committee addressing issues at two-year colleges, or special issues arising when teaching computing outside of North America.

Special session proposal review is NOT blind. Criteria used in reviewing the proposals will include the likely level of interest in the session and the suitability and feasibility of the proposed format to its topic. If the proposal is accepted, all presenters listed in the special session description will be required to register for the conference and to participate in the session.

SIGCSE special session proposals are reviewed using EasyChair. Authors submit a special session proposal by Sept. 1, 2017. Assigned reviewers submit their anonymous reviews through EasyChair by the review deadline (Sept. 20, 2017), making a recommendation along with a rationale using the conference review form in EasyChair.  Each proposal is assigned to at least three reviewers.

Dates for notification of acceptance and camera-ready submission can be found on the detail page for each specific submission type.
