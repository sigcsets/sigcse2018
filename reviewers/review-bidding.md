## SIGCSE 2018 Bidding Process

These are the instructions for doing paper bidding for the SIGCSE 2018 conference.  Paper bidding will open on Sunday August 27th and close on Friday September 1st. During this period, you are encouraged to bid for papers that you are interested in reviewing.  We will send several reminders to register your bids before the end of the bidding period.

Following the abstract submission deadline (August 25th), reviewers and associate program committee (APC) members bid on papers of interest and register conflicts. This process is used in an effort to best match papers with reviewer’s and APC’s expertise. Based on the bidding, the Program Co-Chairs will assign papers to reviewers and APCs. Each paper is assigned to at least three reviewers and exactly one APC.

### Instructions

1. Log into EasyChair
2. Select “Paper Bidding” from the top bar in the window

Bid for as many papers as you can. We will assign you __no more than 3 papers__ to review. If we need more reviews for certain papers, we will contact you before assigning you more papers. Please note that we cannot guarantee you will only be assigned to your _Yes_ bids; however, we will do our very best to honor your bidding choices.
